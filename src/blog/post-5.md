Step-by-Step Guide to Designing a Custom T-Shirt with AI
--------------------------------------------------------

### 1\. The Prompt

**Creating a good Prompt:** The key to getting the best results from AI is to provide clear and detailed prompts. For example, if you’re using an AI tool to generate artwork, describe the style, colors, and elements you want to include. For instance:

> “Create a retro-style t-shirt design with vibrant colors and a summer theme.”

### 2\. Make it Personal

Those are interesting but I want to make something that speaks to my own sense of individuality, I want to feature San Diego, where I live and one of my favorite artists: Mary Blair from Disney in the 50's. I’m not even sure what this might look like, but we can use AI’s ability to make connections with seemingly unrelated topics.

> “create a t-shirt that says "Sunny San Diego" with the city skyline and light orange and blue colors, style of Mary Blair”

![How to Design a Custom T-Shirt with AI: A Beginner’s Guide -- Creating a Good Prompt](../_assets/first_prompt.webp) **Refinement:** That's nice, but not really what I'm looking for. It doesn't feel "Mary Blair" enough to me. I'm going to nudge more towards Disney and I want to put some palm trees in there.

![How to Design a Custom T-Shirt with AI: A Beginner’s Guide - Second prompt](../_assets/second_prompt.webp) I actually like the the the second option, it has a spelling error, but I can copy one of the good "n"'s. So now I'll tell the AI to create variations based on the version I like and see what it does. ![How to Design a Custom T-Shirt with AI: A Beginner’s Guide -- refining the prompts](../_assets/vary_strong.webp) I like the how the city looks in the first option, it reminds me of the iconic Disney logo with the castle in the background. But I do not like the text. I want to take the text from the first option I liked and put it on this one. The will require some editing which I will do in Photoshop. ![How to Design a Custom T-Shirt with AI: A Beginner’s Guide -- Refining](../_assets/keep_the_good_parts.webp)

### 3\. Mix and Match What You Like

I'm going to use some AI features in photoshop to automatically remove text from the second option. You can find this after making a selection in Edit>Generative Fill... Then you can put in the prompt "Remove Text" (It's prompts all the way down) And isn't this truly the future we were promised years ago. We should be giving explicit instructions to the computer. That's the future we deserve! ![How to Design a Custom T-Shirt with AI: A Beginner’s Guide -- Photoshoping](../_assets/Photoshop-Generative-Fill.png) Then I use Photoshop to extract the Text out of the first option and put it into the second option fixing the typo in the process. ![How to Design a Custom T-Shirt with AI: A Beginner’s Guide -- More Refining](../_assets/Drop-the-Text-In-297x300.webp) Finally I add a bit of a drop-shadow to the word San Diego to help blend in with the background better, fix little errors and make some color adjustments. ![How to Design a Custom T-Shirt with AI: A Beginner’s Guide](../_assets/how_to_design_with_AI.webp)
